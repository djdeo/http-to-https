## Other Tips

### Improve web loading speed

All the guides go deep into how to upgrade to Https from Http, go through all the details and eventually you'll get the Https-ed  site only to find that the page's loading a little bit slower than before.

And it's due to the Https, which we cannot modify, but we can improve HTML, CSS, and JS to make page loading faster. So the very first to do after updating to Https is to check the page source code again and see if we can improve them with deleting or decreasing extra http request. Do we need to rewrite some template page?
